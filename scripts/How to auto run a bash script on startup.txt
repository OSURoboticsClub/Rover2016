Here is how you call bash scripts once boot is complete.

Go to the etc directory:
cd /etc/
Here, there is a file called "rc.local".  this file will run commands after startup.
Edit the file and append this command to run startup.sh.  
bash ~/<Script directory in repo>/startup.sh

Now startup.sh will be auto run after start up is complete.

Add the following commands to the startup.sh file:


cd to working directory on rover machine
source ../../../devel/setup.bash

change to directory
roslaunch tests.launch
